server - one who responds to request
       -> gives different kinds of information

types of server

->Application server 
->Database server
->Authentication server
->Game server
->Cloud server


step1:- chrome -> http login -> login using a name and pass
step2:- wireshark-> in search panel (adjacent to bookmark) -> search(http.request)

http -> hyper text transfer protocol

     ->it is a language of a tool that clients and server used to communicate through internet

     -> http request contains http method , URL , header  + body

Types of methods

     -> get    -> to fetch the data
        post   -> creating the data
        put    -> update the data
        delete -> to remove the data
 
->URL -> Uniform Resource Locator (address of the resource you want to access)

parts of URL(2 parts)

->Base URL
->Path

Headers -> to help the server to understand the request

->Content Type it tells the server what format you request (eg: sending json format)

->User Agent tells the server which devise or browser is sending the request(mac or windows showing)

->Body the request body is the main data you send to the server

rules:-
  
    (1)-> client must always start the  communication
   
    (2)-> every http communication has 2 parts(displays website or 404 error)
     
    (3)-> http follows a fixed request structure
  
    (4)-> server must send a status code in every response

    (5)-> user standard method ( get, post,...)
   
    (6)->URL must identify what you want
   
    (7)-> https straight less

    (8)->data must be in text format

    (9)-> client must specify data type

    (10)-> http response must follow structure

    (11)-> use of http version

    (12)-> communication must follow ascii text encoding

    (13)-> http can work over any media layer 

    (14)-> http does not care about the device
   
    (15)-> 1.0,1.1,2,3 ->http versions

TCP/UDP -> TCP-> doesn't' allow interrupts ask it to wait and retransmit

UDP-> allow inturrupts but it dosent hear the signal

json format -> java script object notation

-> used to send data between client and server

why json?

-> easy to read 
-> easy to write.
-> light weight.
-> represented using key value pair
-> works in all programming languages

response in json

JSON format rules

-> must start with "{"

-> key must be in doublequotes("")

-> values can be string , num , Boolean , array , obj , null

-> data are separated by comma


extensible markup language -- > it is a structured way of storing the data using tags(xml)

-> xml can create thier own tags eg: <name>Surya</name>

-> every xml file start with a single root element that wraps all data eg: <it>
                                                                            <stud>
                                                                             <stud1>Sharan</stud1>
                                                                             <stud2>Sharif</stud2>
                                                                             <stud3>Guru</stud3>
                                                                            </stud>
                                                                           </it>

TOMCAT

-> IT IS A webserver + java servlet container that runs java web application

-> it accepts http requests 

-> runs your java code

-> sent that http response

WHY TOMCAT?

-> broweser speak http

-> java application speak java code

-> Tomcat acts like a translator

-> coverts http into java calls

-> Tom cat is the middle man that connects web request with java programs


ARCHITECTURE

-> catelina 

-> coyota

-> jasper (to convert .jsp file to java )


BIN

-> start & stop

CONF

-> configure files

LIB

-> contain java files

LOG

-> it stores the error that occurs in the system

TEMP

-> temporary storage

WEBAPPS

-> here is where we should do  all our coding and application (like reactapp folder)(deployment folder)
