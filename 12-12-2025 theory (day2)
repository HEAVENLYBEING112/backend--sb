SERVLET

-> it is a java program that runs on a server and handles web request and web response 

-> it is a java class that receives data from browser , process it and send back the response 


NEED OF SERVLETS'

-> login validation , database operations , calculations eg: when the user clicks login the form data goes to a servlet which checks the username or password and sends the output to the browser 

-> normal java program --> it runs locally on your computer executed using java myprogram

-> servlet it runs inside a web sever eg: Tomcat

-> automatically executed when a browser sends a request

-> inputs comes from http request html/JSON/xml send back to browser 

HOW THEY RECEIVE THE INPUT

-> scanner sc = new scanner(system.in);
   int x = sc.nextInt();
   /* input comes from the user through keyboard (to get query input) */

-> in servlet --> it receives http request data :
                                                  -> form data
                                                  -> URL parameters
                                                  -> cookies
                                                  -> JSON body

-> Stingname = request.getParameter("username"); /* get input in servlet */

HOW THEY GIVE THE OUTPUT

-> java -> you must run it manually 

-> servlet -> it is never called manually it is always called by the server when a request comes eg: http:\\localhost:8080\login

-> browser calls servlet --> tomcat executes it --> response goes back /* working path of servlet mechanism */

-> response.getWriter().println("<h1>Hello user</h1>"); /* output is sent to the browser (chrome) */


SERVLET API

-> it is a set of interfaces and classes provided by java (Jakarta) which allows you to 
                                                                                      1 -> create servlets (.java files)
                                                                                      2 -> handles the http request
                                                                                      3 -> read data send by the browser 
                                                                                      4 -> sends the response back
                                                                                      5 -> controls the servlet life cycle
                                                                                      6 -> interacts with the server
                                                                                      
KEY INTERFACE AND CLASSES 

-> httpServlet --- you overwrite doGet() --> fetch the data
                                 doPut() --> update the data
                                 doPost() --> create the data
                                 doDelete() --> remove the data

-> httpServletRequest --- used to read the data sent by the browser 
                                                                 (1) -> form
                                                                     -> query parameters
                                                                     -> headers
                                                                     -> cookies
                                                                     eg: String name = request.getParameter("username");

-> httpServletResponse --- used to send output to browser  eg: response.getWriter().println("login success");

-> RequestDispatcher --- it is an object used to transfer the request from one servlet or jsp to another servlet or jsp and also it insert another page into the current response 

SERVLET LIFE CYCLE

-> a servlet goes through these phases 
                                      (1)-> Load (container decides to load  the servlet)
                                      (2)-> Instantiate (container creates one servlet object)
                                      (3)-> Initialize (init (ServletConfig))-this is called once 
                                      (4)-> ServRequest (service()-> doGet method / doPost method ...etc this is called per request many time multithreaded
                                      (5)-> Destroy (destroy method() -> this is called once before the servlet is removed or unloaded
                                      (6)-> Garbage Collection (after destroy)

SERVLET PHASE 

LOAD
                                                                          
-> tomcat loads the servlet class using JDM                                                                

WHEN DOES IT HAPPEN

-> configuration @WebServlet(value = "/login",loadOnStartup = 1)

INSTANTIATE

-> container uses new to create one instance of your servlet class                                          

INITIALIZE 

-> called once immediately after instantiation                                                             

SERVICE

-> called for every request                                                                                 

DESTROY

-> called once by the container when it decides to remove the servlet (server shutdown , reload)           

GARBAGE COLLECTION

-> JDM will eventually reclaim the servlet object memory
