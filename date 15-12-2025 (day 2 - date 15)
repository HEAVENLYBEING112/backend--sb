SPRINGBOOT

-> it is a java framework
'
-> it is an upgraded version of spring

-> like a template in canva for resume it is a frame work 

-> dependencies will be auto assigned in spring-boot and for spring we need to assign in manually

-> to run tomcat in spring boot we just need a single command (mvn spring-boot:run) ---> command

-> spring has 20-30 lines of code whereas same for spring boot only 3-4 lines

-> microservice is supported by spring boot and not by spring

-> 70% is servlet in spring but in spring boot it has maximum content of spring and also has own other information

ANNOTATION

-> annotation is a data which holds metadata

-> initialized with @ symbol

LAYERS

(4)-> CONTROLLERS --> to receive http request

(5)-> DTO(DATA TRANSFER OBJECT) --> only required information will be extracted here
